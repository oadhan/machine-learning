Purpose: The purpose of this project was to select a predictive model and analyze its fairness and accuracy. 
The model chosen was an entry into the Inter American Development Bank (IADM) contest to create a more accurate 
Automated Decision System (ADS) using machine learning methods to more fairly distribute aid based on various factors 
that have previously been ignored like specific household attributes like material of their walls, ceilings and 
other related assets.

Method: The chosen entry was a gradient boosted decision trees model trained on 142 input variables including tangible 
features of the houses of the households, gender ratios of the households, education levels, etc. The model is then 
used to predict outcomes for the test data. The outcome predicted is a score between 1- 4 to indicate the poverty level of
the household. This entry was validated using the following methods:
- Prediction made with model
- Accuracy of prediction model checked (91.42259414225941)
- Confusion matrix heat map
