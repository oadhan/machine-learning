Purpose: To train a regression machine learning model on movie ratings provided by users on a streaming platform and
improve the RMSE (Root-mean-square deviation) or in other words, minimize the difference between the predicated values
and the actual values.

Method:
1. Pre-processed data - parsed through data, converted date time field to numerical variable, and replaced NaN entries
with an average rating (3)
2. Split data into training and test sets
3. Trained a multiple regression model and calculated the model's RMSE
4. Trained a linear regression model for each predictor vairable and calculated the model's RMSE to see which variable
outputed the most accurate predictions

Note: The ratings.csv file was far too large to upload to GitHub, so this file cannot be found in this repository.
